# CV - Chris Merry
I've been developing javascript driven mobile web apps, SCORM eLearning modules, iOS, Android, and Windows Phone apps, dynamic bespoke eLearning sites, and a variety of other web material for blue chip clients including Marks and Spencer, UCL, and Bureau Veritas, for more than 10 years. 

One big contract for M&S recently has been converting technical manuals into mobile web apps, easily portable and navigable, and very green.
